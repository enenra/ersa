# Extendable Research System Addon
An addon to Equinox' Extendable Research System: https://github.com/Equinox-/ResearchCore

This mod is available on the Steam Workshop: [COMING SOON]

## Features
### Items
* Adds a Research Lab block to the game.
* Adds a Data Storage block to the game.
* Adds physical blueprint items for every research tree item to the game.

### Gameplay
* Research a technology on the research tree by researching the blueprint for it in the Research Lab.
* When held, this physical blueprint item will unlock the blocks and options for production / refining that were assigned to the respective technology.
* In order to research the next technology on the tree, the previous technology's blueprint is required.
* Blueprints must be stored in the Data Storage block, they cannot be stored in any other container.
* Players can share blueprints with other player, or steal blueprints from other players, but holding them will not unlock the previous technologies in the research tree. As a result, players cannot skip large parts of the research tree at a time.
* Each player can only have a single Research Lab block in use at a time.

### Modding
* This mod does not contain a research tree, but allows other modders to create their own research trees using this and Equinox' Extendable Research System's features in a streamlined manner.
* All the required definitions file entries that are required to create a research tree for this mod can easily be created in the provided comprehensive Google Spreadsheet.
