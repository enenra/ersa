# Extendable Research System Addon
An addon to Equinox' Extendable Research System: https://github.com/Equinox-/ResearchCore

This mod is available on the Steam Workshop: [ERSA - Extendable Research System Addon](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1632059698)

An example research tree of all vanilla items is available on the Steam Workshop: [ERSA Vanilla](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1632059698)

## Features
### Items
* Adds a Research Lab block to the game.
* Adds a Data Storage block to the game.
* Adds physical blueprint items for every research tree item to the game.
* Adds Research Material components to the game.

### Gameplay
* Produce Research Material components in the Assembler.
* Research a technology on the tech tree by researching the blueprint for it in the Research Lab and providing it with enough Research Materials.
* When held, this physical blueprint item will unlock the blocks and options for production and refining that were assigned to the technology associated with this blueprint.
* In order to research the next technology on the tree, the previous technology's blueprint is required.
* Blueprints must be stored in the Data Storage block, they cannot be stored in any other container.*
* Players can share blueprints with other players, or steal blueprints from other players, but holding them will not unlock the previous technologies in the research tree - only the ones contained within the blueprint. As a result, players cannot skip large parts of the research tree at a time.
* Each player can only have a single Research Lab block in use at a time. *

*This is not yet implemented.

### Modding
* This contains a research tree for all vanilla blocks, but also allows other modders to create their own research trees using this and Equinox' Extendable Research System's features in a streamlined manner.
* All the required definitions file entries necessary to set up a research tree for this mod can easily be created in the provided comprehensive Google Spreadsheet.
